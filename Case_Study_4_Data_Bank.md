## üìä Business Questions & SQL Solutions

### 1. How many customers have joined each month?
Short Summary: Group customers by signup month.
```sql
SELECT
  DATE_TRUNC('month', start_date) AS signup_month,
  COUNT(customer_id) AS new_customers
FROM customers
GROUP BY signup_month
ORDER BY signup_month;
```

### 2. How many customers signed up with each product?
Short Summary: Customer count per product.
```sql
SELECT
  p.product_name,
  COUNT(c.customer_id) AS customer_count
FROM customers c
JOIN products p
  ON c.primary_product_id = p.product_id
GROUP BY p.product_name;
```

### 3. How are customers distributed across different regions?
Short Summary: Region-wise distribution of customers.
```sql
SELECT
  r.region_name,
  COUNT(c.customer_id) AS customers_in_region
FROM customers c
JOIN regions r
  ON c.region_id = r.region_id
GROUP BY r.region_name
ORDER BY customers_in_region DESC;
```

### 4. Which customers have churned (no transactions recorded)?
Short Summary: Customers without any transactions are considered churned.
```sql
SELECT
  c.customer_id
FROM customers c
LEFT JOIN customer_transactions t
  ON c.customer_id = t.customer_id
WHERE t.customer_id IS NULL;
```

### 5. What is the monthly revenue trend?
Short Summary: Monthly revenue generated from transactions.
```sql
SELECT
  DATE_TRUNC('month', txn_date) AS revenue_month,
  SUM(txn_amount) AS total_revenue
FROM customer_transactions
GROUP BY revenue_month
ORDER BY revenue_month;
```

### 6. What is the average number of products used by customers?
Short Summary: Find the average number of different products used.
```sql
SELECT
  AVG(products_used) AS avg_products_used
FROM (
  SELECT
    customer_id,
    COUNT(DISTINCT product_id) AS products_used
  FROM customer_transactions
  GROUP BY customer_id
) subquery;
```

### 7. What is the revenue breakdown by product and region?
Short Summary: Revenue earned by each product across regions.
```sql
SELECT
  p.product_name,
  r.region_name,
  SUM(t.txn_amount) AS total_revenue
FROM customer_transactions t
JOIN customers c
  ON t.customer_id = c.customer_id
JOIN products p
  ON c.primary_product_id = p.product_id
JOIN regions r
  ON c.region_id = r.region_id
GROUP BY p.product_name, r.region_name
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC;
```
