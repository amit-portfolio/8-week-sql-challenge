## üìä Business Questions & SQL Solutions

### 1. How many unique users visited each page?
Short Summary: Count distinct users per page.
```sql
SELECT
  p.page_name,
  COUNT(DISTINCT e.user_id) AS unique_visitors
FROM events e
JOIN page_hierarchy p
  ON e.page_id = p.page_id
GROUP BY p.page_name
ORDER BY unique_visitors DESC;
```

### 2. What percentage of users visited the homepage?
Short Summary: Homepage visitors out of total users.
```sql
WITH total_users AS (
  SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) AS total_count FROM events
)
SELECT
  ROUND(
    (COUNT(DISTINCT e.user_id) * 100.0) / (SELECT total_count FROM total_users),
    2
  ) AS homepage_visit_percentage
FROM events e
WHERE e.page_id = 1;
```

### 3. What percentage of users visited about, product, and careers pages?
Short Summary: Visit percentage for major informational pages.
```sql
WITH total_users AS (
  SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) AS total_count FROM events
)
SELECT
  p.page_name,
  ROUND(
    (COUNT(DISTINCT e.user_id) * 100.0) / (SELECT total_count FROM total_users),
    2
  ) AS visit_percentage
FROM events e
JOIN page_hierarchy p
  ON e.page_id = p.page_id
WHERE p.page_name IN ('About', 'Product', 'Careers')
GROUP BY p.page_name;
```

### 4. What percentage of users visited the contact page?
Short Summary: Contact page visit rate.
```sql
WITH total_users AS (
  SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) AS total_count FROM events
)
SELECT
  ROUND(
    (COUNT(DISTINCT e.user_id) * 100.0) / (SELECT total_count FROM total_users),
    2
  ) AS contact_page_visit_percentage
FROM events e
WHERE e.page_id = 5;
```

### 5. What is the bounce rate?
Short Summary: Users who viewed only one page.
```sql
WITH user_activity AS (
  SELECT
    user_id,
    COUNT(DISTINCT page_id) AS pages_visited
  FROM events
  GROUP BY user_id
)
SELECT
  ROUND(
    (COUNT(CASE WHEN pages_visited = 1 THEN 1 END) * 100.0) / COUNT(*),
    2
  ) AS bounce_rate_percentage
FROM user_activity;
```

### 6. How do users navigate between pages?
Short Summary: Page transition analysis.
```sql
WITH navigation_paths AS (
  SELECT
    user_id,
    page_id,
    LEAD(page_id) OVER (PARTITION BY user_id ORDER BY event_time) AS next_page_id
  FROM events
)
SELECT
  p1.page_name AS current_page,
  p2.page_name AS next_page,
  COUNT(*) AS transitions
FROM navigation_paths np
JOIN page_hierarchy p1
  ON np.page_id = p1.page_id
JOIN page_hierarchy p2
  ON np.next_page_id = p2.page_id
WHERE np.next_page_id IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY current_page, next_page
ORDER BY transitions DESC;
```

### 7. What is the conversion rate from homepage to contact page?
Short Summary: % of users who moved from homepage to contact page.
```sql
WITH homepage_users AS (
  SELECT DISTINCT user_id
  FROM events
  WHERE page_id = 1
),
contact_users AS (
  SELECT DISTINCT user_id
  FROM events
  WHERE page_id = 5
)
SELECT
  ROUND(
    (COUNT(DISTINCT cu.user_id) * 100.0) / (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM homepage_users),
    2
  ) AS homepage_to_contact_conversion_percentage
FROM contact_users cu
JOIN homepage_users hu
  ON cu.user_id = hu.user_id;
```
