## üìä Business Questions & SQL Solutions

### 1. How many successful orders were delivered by each runner?
Short Summary: Counting successful deliveries where pickup time is not null.
```sql
SELECT
  runner_id,
  COUNT(*) AS successful_deliveries
FROM runner_orders
WHERE pickup_time IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY runner_id;
```

### 2. What is the total distance traveled by each runner?
Short Summary: Summing up distance for each runner for successful deliveries.
```sql
SELECT
  runner_id,
  SUM(distance) AS total_distance_km
FROM runner_orders
WHERE pickup_time IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY runner_id;
```

### 3. What was the average speed for each runner for each delivery?
Short Summary: Calculating average speed using distance and duration.
```sql
SELECT
  runner_id,
  ROUND(AVG(distance / (duration/60)), 2) AS avg_speed_kmph
FROM runner_orders
WHERE pickup_time IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY runner_id;
```

### 4. What is the count of cancellations for each runner?
Short Summary: Counting orders where cancellation reason is provided.
```sql
SELECT
  runner_id,
  COUNT(*) AS cancellation_count
FROM runner_orders
WHERE cancellation IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY runner_id;
```

### 5. What are the reasons for cancellation and their counts?
Short Summary: Finding top reasons customers cancel their orders.
```sql
SELECT
  cancellation,
  COUNT(*) AS reason_count
FROM runner_orders
WHERE cancellation IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY cancellation
ORDER BY reason_count DESC;
```

### 6. What percentage of orders were successfully delivered?
Short Summary: Calculating success rate out of total orders.
```sql
SELECT
  ROUND(
    (SUM(CASE WHEN pickup_time IS NOT NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 100.0) / COUNT(*),
    2
  ) AS success_rate_percentage
FROM runner_orders;
```

### 7. What is the average delivery time taken by each runner?
Short Summary: Finding how long it typically takes a runner to deliver an order.
```sql
SELECT
  runner_id,
  ROUND(AVG(duration), 2) AS avg_delivery_time_mins
FROM runner_orders
WHERE pickup_time IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY runner_id;
```

### 8. How many pizzas were ordered by each customer?
Short Summary: Counting pizza orders per customer.

```sql
SELECT
  pn.pizza_name,
  COUNT(co.pizza_id) AS pizza_count
FROM customer_orders co
JOIN pizza_names pn
  ON co.pizza_id = pn.pizza_id
GROUP BY pn.pizza_name
ORDER BY pizza_count DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

### 10. How many pizzas has each customer ordered in total over their lifetime?
Short Summary: Total pizza consumption per customer.
